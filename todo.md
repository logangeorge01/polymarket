[] fix logan shitty error handling in getmarket(byid)

[X] make market display on separate page with marketid in the path e.g. polyinterface.com/0xc61d58d10dd07c779f61a961e9ecc3c3ed298c23e2503dc8145b6a44fc5abb53

[] make order buttons simpler - should only need one of them, I think it's FOK fill or kill which is fill entire order immediately or cancel

[] general sell positions button

[] stop react making multiple duplicate calls during routing or after clicking buttons - check console logs

[] input field for unit quantity

[] maybe get order book call to ensure liquidity without too much slippage - show resulting price change in buy button

[] make models/poly.ts file with data structures to help with types

[] implement getEarningsForUserForDay
